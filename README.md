##  Abstract
Suicide is a major public health concern, and social media has become a prominent medium for expressing suicidal ideation. Although machine learning techniques have demonstrated satisfactory performance in suicide prediction models, their inability to be interpreted hinders our ability to comprehend the causes of suicidal behaviour. To address this, we propose an explainable prediction model that employs machine learning algorithms, such as Logistics Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and Support Vector Machines, as well as transformer-based models BERT and DistilBERT, to identify suicide intent in social media conversations. We employ the SHAP methodology to interpret the model's predictions and identify the key factors that contribute to the prediction. In addition, the SHAP approach allowed us to identify the most important characteristics of suicidal behaviour, such as the use of negative words, expressions of despondency, and references to death. The experimental result indicates that Logistics regression achieved the best results in the Machine learning category, with an accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score of 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.93 respectively, and in the Transformer based classifier, the BERT classifier achieved the best result, with an accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score of 0.90, 0.90, 0.90, and 0.90 respectively. The proposed model has the potential to aid mental health professionals and social media platforms in identifying individuals at risk of suicide and providing opportune intervention. The decision-making process is transparent and trustworthy due to its explicable nature.
